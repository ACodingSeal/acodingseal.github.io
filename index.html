<li><span style='color:#00FF00;font-weight:bold'>[100%]</span> [6 September 2023 18:40] <a href='./Infinite Progress Bars'>Infinite Progress Bars</a>: A small game I created, having created its release version (<b>v0.0.1</b>) in under an hour. I originally challenged myself to create the game within 150 lines while still being readable (i.e. not obfuscating), but ended up doing it within 50 (and could be less using some optimisations, like removing comments). Regardless, I'm proud of Infinite Progress Bars, despite its simplicity. In version <b>0.0.2</b>, some minor optimisations were made and a rebirth system and statistics tracker were added. <b>v0.0.2a</b> fixes some bugs. <b>v0.0.2b</b> adds the actual progress bar (the background of each progress bar being X amount full, based on percentage complete). <b>v0.0.2c</b> adds the long-awaited save system, as well as giving slightly increasing requirements for each progress bar, which also makes them appear as if they're increasing at different rates.</li>
